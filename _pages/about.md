I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://www.ttic.edu), where I am fortunate to work with [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/). My research interests encompass the fields of speech and natural language processing technologies. Here are some topics I have been focusing on recently:

- **Speech-Text Joint Learning**\
Can speech models learn better/faster with the aids of text? Do speech-text models learn anything different from speech-only models?
- **Speech Generation**\
Control and model non-lexical information in generated speech in a more efficient and intuitive way.
- **Self-Supervised Speech Representations**\
Analyze the information encoded in self-supervised speech representations and explore various applications for the learned representations and units.
- **Multi-Modal Learning**\
Text-guided image generation and video-guided speech generation.

Prior to joining TTIC, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/main.php), where I had the privilege of working with [Lin-shan Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) at the [Speech Processing Lab](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw). Outside of school, I also gained valuable experience through summer internships with [Amazon Alexa TTS Research](https://www.amazon.science/tag/text-to-speech) and [FAIR (AI at Meta)](https://ai.meta.com).

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am a sports enthusiasts and amateur athlete. I captained the baseball varsity team of NTU during my undergraduate years. I am also broadly interested in tennis, hiking, scuba diving, swimming, badminton, and training. In 2022, I achieved a personal milestone by completing my first marathon, and I have been dedicated to improving my PB with the goal of breaking the 3:10 mark!
