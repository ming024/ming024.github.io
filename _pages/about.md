I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://www.ttic.edu), advised by [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/). My overarching ambition is to create **Trustworthy and User-Friendly Human-Like Speech AI**. To achieve this goal, my current research is focused on:

- **Factual Conversational Speech AI**\
How to make full-duplex models more intelligent while preserving their interactiveness? How to best preserve the knowledge learned from large-scale text pre-training?
- **Aligning Speech Language Models (SLMs) with Human Preference**\
How to improve various aspects of SLMs -- such as content fidelity, natural turn-taking, and emotional expressiveness -- with human preference? How to enhance overall user experience?

Aside from these, my past research in **Controllable Speech Generation**, **Efficient Fine-Tuning of SLMs**, **Flow-Matching & Diffusion Models**, and **Self-Supervised Speech Representations** have also been crucial experience and provided me valuable foundation on my way towards achieving the goal.

Prior to joining TTIC, I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/main.php), where I had the fortune to work with [Lin-shan Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) at the [Speech Processing Lab](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw). I also gained valuable practical experience through summer internships at [Amazon Alexa TTS Research](https://www.amazon.science/tag/text-to-speech), [FAIR (AI at Meta)](https://ai.meta.com), [NVIDIA NeMo Team](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/conv-ai/), and [Kyutai](https://kyutai.org/).

Beyond my academic and research pursuits, I am an avid sports enthusiast and amateur athlete. During my undergraduate studies, I captained the varsity baseball team at NTU. I maintain a broad interest in tennis, hiking, snowboarding, scuba diving, and badminton. In 2022, I achieved a personal milestone by completing my first marathon and I am currently training to break the 3-hour mark.
