I am a Ph.D. student at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://www.ttic.edu), working with [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/). My research interests cover speech and NLP. Recently, I am particularly interested in the development, analysis, and application of self-supervised representations.

Before joining TTIC, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/main.php) under the supervision of [Lin-shan Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) in the [Speech Processing Lab](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw). I also joined the TTS Research Group of Amazon Alexa in Cambridge, UK, as a science intern in the autumn of 2021.

Aside from being a researcher, I am a sports enthusiasts and an amateur athlete. I captained the baseball varsity team of NTU during my undergraduate years, and I am also broadly interested in tennis, hiking, scuba diving, marathon, swimming, badminton, and training!
