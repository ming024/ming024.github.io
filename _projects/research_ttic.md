      - Discovered speech‑text models with text‑to‑speech transferability which enables <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05919">zero‑shot spoken language understanding</a>
  - title: Self-Supervised Speech Representations
    year: 2022 - Present
    description:
      - Revealed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00162">word‑level language structures</a> intrinsically encoded in self‑supervised speech representations
      - Proved that the encoded information can be used for an unsupervised word segmentation task
