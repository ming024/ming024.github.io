    year: 2021
    description:
      - Worked with Adam Gabryś and Jaime Lorenzo‐Trueba
      - Proposed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08164">Voice Filter</a>, which improved extremely low‐resource speaker‐adaptive text‐to‐speech (TTS) by modeling content and speaker information separately
      - Reduced the gap between synthesized and real speech by over 30%
